## Ideas {style="font-size:1.1em; color:blue"}

1\. Civic Health Dashboard:  Explore the relationship between civic participation (voting turnout) and community well-being (educational attainment, health outcomes like obesity, life expectancy, or access to healthcare).

2\. The Social Gradient in Democracy:  Visualize how educational inequality and health disparities predict or correlate with voter participation.

3\. Education, Health, and the Vote Over Time: Focus on temporal change. How have turnout rates, graduation rates, and public health measures shifted together over the past decades?

4\. Education & Health as Predictors of Swing State Outcomes: Examine whether educational attainment and health outcomes correlate with swing state behavior in elections (close margins, shifts between parties).

5\. Civic Deserts and Civic Gardens: Identify areas where low education, poor health, and low turnout overlap (“civic deserts”) vs. areas with high values on all three (“civic gardens”).

6\. Life Expectancy and the Vote: Investigate whether counties/states with higher or lower life expectancy tend to vote differently and whether education mediates this effect.
