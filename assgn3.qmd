### Objective
Use `tidycensus` to retrieve ACS 2023 5-year estimates, create a tidy dataset, and produce **one map** and **one table** with short interpretation.

### Tasks

#### Setup
- [ ] Obtain a Census API key  
- [ ] In R: `census_api_key("Your_Key", install = FALSE)`
- [ ] Install and load R packages: `tidycensus`, `tigris`, `sf`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`

#### Choose a geography and variable(s)
- [ ] Geography: one of `state`, `county`, `tract`, or `block group` (within a state)  
- [ ] Variables: pick **at least two** ACS variables (e.g., `B19013_001` median HH income, `B17001_002` people below poverty)  
- [ ] Use `load_variables(2023, "acs5", cache = TRUE)` to search codes

#### Download data (with geometry)
- [ ] Use `get_acs()` with your geography and variables  
- [ ] Keep `estimate` and `moe`


#### Deliverables
- [ ] Map: choropleth of one variable (with a clear legend and title)  
- [ ] Table: top/bottom 10 areas by the other variable (include MOE)  
- [ ] Interpret map and table data
