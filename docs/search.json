Following that peak, there is a steep drop until it rises again on 7/19/2024. It remains pretty stagnant at below 25, then peaks twice on 9/11 & 9/15. The term then remains stagnant until late October, where a steady rise peaks on 11/7/2024. There is then a significant drop off the following month.\nKamala: For the term Kamala, there is a peak at below 50 on 7/21/2024, with a drop and several peaks that remain at or below 25 until reaching a peak on 9/11/2024. The term remains stagnant until October and sees a gradual rise until it reaches a peak on 11/7/2024. There is a significant drop and it remains below 25 the following month.\nElection: The terms ‚ÄúElection‚Äù remains below 25, and gradually begins to rise in the end of October and reaches a peak on 11/7/2024.
